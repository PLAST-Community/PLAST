# PLAST
##### Pattern Languages for Systemic Interpretation & Transformation
Connecting knowledge semantically across domains (disciplines - domains of application - specialization languages) and abstraction levels (concepts - praxis) through systemic interpretation elements / descriptors that enable the sharing of systemic stories.

## Vision 
By systemically and semantically marking up and relating different kinds of knowledge, and by enabling navigation within this networked knowledge, collective intelligence can be operationalized and collective action (whether co-operation or co-laboration) enhanced in a way that ensures that intentions, action and the effects they produce can be compared through systemic stories and reoriented when needed. 

## Description of the project
The major objective of the PLAST project is to bring together communities of practice from multiple disciplines and domains around an open knowledge repository of shared sustainable and socially innovative practices, federated into a commons. The project will leverage pattern languages to make knowledge accessible and reusable across domains, turning knowledge and ‘know-how’ into repeatable results and coherent systemic outcomes. The key operating principle of PLAST is to make communities of practice aware of each other’s solutions and achievements in a language that they can understand, so that successes can be explained, remixed, applied, and evaluated for their effectiveness across domains. 

We seek to build a open knowledge platform that encourages systemic inquiry and collective exploration of adjacent possibilities by providing the ability to document, discuss and deliberate the intentions and outcomes of systemic interventions and change initiatives. Most importantly, by capturing and analysing the social process of deliberating effective sustainable practice, PLAST will allow reflexive improvement in the process of transformation itself.

## Work Processes and project development
We will open up streams to develop in parallel:
- Work processes
- Set of tools
- Semantic / systemic operators (writing systemic stories)
- Orientation engine (using engagement logic heuristics)

We intend to develop a base infrastructure so that work can start with minimal set up / work / learning curve, and to get people / communities to engage, and a set of structuring principles so that the project can scale.

We wish to attract individuals and communities that have a professional / occupational interest in developing the project. Individul / group projects will be federated / aggregated as use cases, using shared semantic and orientation tools to write their own systemic stories.

We will develop PLAST as its own use case: developing patterns for our vision and work processes as open / stigmergetic project that could be applied to other open projects. 

We intend to design work processes that enable us to collaboratively maintain PLAST's vision and work processes as a use case of the project, and to co-operatively develop our own operational use cases that will be aggregated in a shared pool of commons knowledge.

## Roadmap / tasks
1. write and maintain this project description and list of resources (mid August to mid September).
2. inform and convene our core group of supporters to start evaluating tools and working on work processes (mid September).
3. define the PLAST pattern language: how we work, what we do
3. Set up / integrate the start tools and work processes so that the project can attract participation and develop organically.

## Drafts list of features needed / possible tools
##### Features
- Semantic database / repository that can be queried by other tools
- Retrieving of individual patterns and building of sequences
- Discussion of patterns individually and in sequence and tracks of discussions
- Orientation (using engagement logics, angles of approach), queries etc
- ...

##### Possible tools
- Semantic wiki (not great for federated, i.e. individual aspect?)
- PatternPedia on Semantic MediaWiki (is there a demo open source version to play with?)
- Smallest Federated wiki (not great for scaling aggregation and co-laboration? participate in Ward Cunningham's video sessions with David & Ksenya)
- Github
- René Reiner's Pattern evolution library (is there a demo open source version to play with?)
- Trello (work flow)
- Slack (work process discussion, integration of notification, simulations/bot?)
- 'Orientation' game / engine based on engagement logics and why/what/how/who framework to be developped
- ...

## Resources and documentation
From which to abstract and synthesize project description and work elements

##### Work elements:
**Conceptual elements**
- Presentation [Bridging the Systemic and Semantic Spheres](http://www.slideshare.net/helenefinidori/systemic-interpretation-language) ten slides highlight, conceptual summary of the project.
- [Logics of Engagement and Action on the repo's wiki](https://github.com/PLAST-Community/PLAST/wiki/Logics-of-Engagement-and-Action) two slides framework for orientation / semantic enquiry
- [What PLAST does](https://github.com/PLAST-Community/PLAST/wiki/What-PLAST-Does) two slides on how PLAST operates in relation to the dimensionalities of engagement in change. 

**Implementation elements**
- The [PLAST proposal for CAPS Horizon2020](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1hB6w2xjIXAc3JhYmhCQXMwdGc/view?usp=sharing)sections 1-3, including work packages.
- [First set of systemic interpretation elements](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1hB6w2xjIXAcWV1dUFMUGRWSm8/view?usp=sharing) used at the Purplsoc conference to share systemic stories. (need to finalize and post report here).
- 
**Technical elements**
- Need link to PatternPedia and René Reiner's pattern library and pattern evolution tool.
