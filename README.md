# PLAST
##### Pattern Languages for Systemic Interpretation & Transformation
Connecting knowledge semantically across domains (disciplines - domains of application - specialization languages) and abstraction levels (concepts - praxis) through systemic interpretation elements / descriptors that enable the sharing of systemic stories. More info on [Vision & Description of theproject](https://github.com/PLAST-Community/PLAST/wiki/Vision-&-Description-of-the-Project)

## Roadmap / tasks
1. write and maintain this project description and list of resources (mid August to mid September).
2. inform and convene our core group of supporters to answer the question "where do we want to start": start outlining work processes and evaluating tools to start the project (mid September).
3. each community member defines what he wants to work on / develop and finds areas of overlap with others so things can evolve organically in an agile way.
4. define the actions and workflows to support as a whole
5. set up / integrate the point zero start tools and work processes so that people can get started and the project can attract participation and develop organically.

## Project development
We will open up streams to get started with and develop in parallel:
- Work processes (a pattern language of the PLAST project?)
- Set of tools (interface type wiki, semantic database, discussion space)
- Semantic / systemic interpretation elements (to write systemic stories)
- Orientation engine/tools (to navigate across levels of understanding and semiotic relationships) and hermeneutical approach

We intend to develop a base infrastructure so that work can start with minimal set up / work / learning curve, and to get people / communities to engage, and a set of structuring principles so that things can be reconfigured and structured along the way, and so that the project can scale.

We wish to attract individuals and communities that have a professional / occupational interest in developing their own  projects in connection with the PLAST. Each develops her/is own project in relation with others with whom there is an overlap. Individual / group projects will be federated / aggregated as use cases, using shared semantic and orientation tools to write their own systemic stories.

We will develop PLAST as its own use case: developing patterns for our vision and work processes as open / stigmergetic project that could be applied to other open projects. 

We intend to design work processes that enable us to collaboratively maintain PLAST's vision and work processes as a use case of the project, and to co-operatively develop our own operational use cases that will be aggregated in a shared pool of commons knowledge

## Drafts list of features needed / possible tools
##### Features
- Semantic database / repository that can be queried by other tools
- Retrieving of individual patterns and building of sequences
- Discussion of patterns individually and in sequence and tracks of discussions
- Orientation (using engagement logics, angles of approach), queries etc
- ...

##### Possible tools
- Semantic wiki (not great for federated, i.e. individual aspect?)
- PatternPedia on Semantic MediaWiki (is there a demo open source version to play with?)
- Smallest Federated wiki (not great for scaling aggregation and co-laboration? participate in Ward Cunningham's video sessions with David & Ksenya)
- Github
- René Reiner's Pattern evolution library (is there a demo open source version to play with?)
- Trello (work flow)
- Slack (work process discussion, integration of notification, simulations/bot?)
- 'Orientation' game / engine based on engagement logics and why/what/how/who framework to be developped
- ...

## Resources and documentation
From which to abstract and synthesize project description and work elements

##### Work elements:
**Conceptual elements**
- Presentation [Bridging the Systemic and Semantic Spheres](http://www.slideshare.net/helenefinidori/systemic-interpretation-language) ten slides highlight, conceptual summary of the project.
- [Logics of Engagement and Action on the repo's wiki](https://github.com/PLAST-Community/PLAST/wiki/Logics-of-Engagement-and-Action) two slides framework for orientation / semantic enquiry
- [What PLAST does](https://github.com/PLAST-Community/PLAST/wiki/What-PLAST-Does) two slides on how PLAST operates in relation to the dimensionalities of engagement in change. 

**Implementation elements**
- The [PLAST proposal for CAPS Horizon2020](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1hB6w2xjIXAc3JhYmhCQXMwdGc/view?usp=sharing)sections 1-3, including work packages.
- [First set of systemic interpretation elements](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1hB6w2xjIXAcWV1dUFMUGRWSm8/view?usp=sharing) used at the Purplsoc conference to share systemic stories. (need to finalize and post report here).

**Technical elements**
- Need link to PatternPedia and René Reiner's pattern library and pattern evolution tool.
