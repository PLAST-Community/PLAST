# PLAST
##### Pattern Languages for Systemic Interpretation & Transformation
Connecting knowledge semantically across domains (disciplines - domains of application - specialization languages) and abstraction levels (concepts - praxis) to actively monitor and collectively interpret the evolving directionality of socio-technological-economic-environmental systems; through systemic interpretation elements / descriptors that help mediate among multiple cultural contexts, perceptions, interpretations and representationsenable and share systemic stories. More info on [Vision & Description of the project](https://github.com/PLAST-Community/PLAST/wiki/Vision-&-Description-of-the-Project)

## Roadmap / tasks
1. write and maintain this project description and list of resources (on-going).
2. inform and convene our core group of supporters to answer the question "where do we want to start" to start outlining work processes and evaluating tools to start the project .
3. each community member defines what he wants to work on / develop and what he needs to viably pursue his project in connection with PLAST and finds areas of overlap with others so things can evolve organically in an agile way.
4. collectively define the actions and workflows to support individually and as a whole.
5. assess existing tools (members of the community could 'advocate' and describe the pros and cons of the tools they prefer). 
6. set up / integrate the point zero start tools and work processes so that people can get started and the project can attract participation and develop organically (we could start to experiement on several, find ways to bridge the data, and compare for decision).

## Project development
We will open up streams to get started with and develop in parallel see dedicated channels on the [PLAST community on Slack](https://plastcommunity.slack.com):
- Work processes (a pattern language of the PLAST project?)see and comment the [PLAST Work Process Draft Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hSe7V8whwuetsTSvtpqkPzVJW6EA37kK682WZCzL_EI/edit)
- Set of tools (interface type wiki, semantic database, discussion space) see and comment the [PLAST Tools Needs & Possibilities Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1thN4hW_JQ2VE9a1IGjM_EJLnHGAmZpiuYmmvok7Ykhw/edit) 
- Semantic / systemic interpretation elements (to decode, encode, write systemic stories)
- Orientation engine/tools (to navigate across levels of understanding and semiotic relationships) and hermeneutical approach

We intend to develop a base infrastructure so that work can start with minimal set up / work / learning curve, and to get people / communities to engage, and a set of structuring principles so that things can be reconfigured and structured along the way, and so that the project can scale.

We wish to attract individuals and communities that have a professional / occupational interest in developing their own  projects in connection with the PLAST. Each develops her/is own project in relation with others with whom there is an overlap. Individual / group projects will be federated / aggregated as use cases, using shared semantic and orientation tools to write their own systemic stories.

We will develop PLAST as its own use case: developing patterns for our vision and work processes as open / stigmergetic project that could be applied to other open projects. 

We intend to design work processes that enable us to collaboratively maintain PLAST's vision and work processes as a use case of the project, and to co-operatively develop our own operational use cases that will be aggregated in a shared pool of commons knowledge

## Drafts list of features needed / possible tools
##### Features
- Semantic database / repository that can be queried by other tools
- Retrieving of individual patterns and building of sequences
- Creation and display of visuals (maps, sketches)
- Discussion of patterns individually and in sequence and tracks of discussions
- Orientation (using engagement logics, angles of approach), queries etc
- ...

##### Possible tools
- Semantic mediawiki (not great for federated, i.e. individual/community authorship, aspect?)
- PatternPedia on Semantic MediaWiki (is there a demo open source version to play with?)
- Smallest Federated wiki (not great for scaling aggregation and co-laboration? participate in Ward Cunningham's video sessions with David & Ksenya). Here is an [experimental Smallest Federated Wiki](http://helene.pattern.academy/view/welcome-visitors) 
- - Wagn (long learning curve?)
- Github. Here we are, the PLAST-Community! :)
- René Reiner's Pattern evolution library and pattern evolution tool (is there a demo open source version to play with?)
- Trello (work flow). There is a [PLAST Trello board](https://trello.com/b/6mE75E1b/plast-in-caps-general-overview-and-discussions) to experiment
- Slack (work process discussion, integration of notification, simulations/bot?) > [PLAST Community on Slack](https://plastcommunity.slack.com) set up
- 'Orientation' game / engine based on engagement logics and why/what/how/who framework to be developped
- ...

## Resources and documentation
From which to abstract and synthesize project description and work elements

##### Work elements:
**Conceptual elements**
- Presentation [Bridging the Systemic and Semantic Spheres](http://www.slideshare.net/helenefinidori/systemic-interpretation-language) ten slides highlight, conceptual summary of the project.
- [Logics of Engagement and Action on the repo's wiki](https://github.com/PLAST-Community/PLAST/wiki/Logics-of-Engagement-and-Action) two slides framework for orientation / semantic enquiry
- [What PLAST does](https://github.com/PLAST-Community/PLAST/wiki/What-PLAST-Does) two slides on how PLAST operates in relation to the dimensionalities of engagement in change. 

**Implementation elements**
- [First set of systemic interpretation elements](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1hB6w2xjIXAcWV1dUFMUGRWSm8/view?usp=sharing) used at the Purplsoc conference to share systemic stories. (need to finalize and post report here).

**Technical elements**
- Need link to PatternPedia and René Reiner's pattern library and pattern evolution tool.
